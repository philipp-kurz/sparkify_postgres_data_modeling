# Project overview
Because the executive suite of the imaginary music streaming startup Sparkify kept hearing that "data is the new oil in the 21st century", they decided to collect any data they could about the songs they offer and their users' listening activity.

However, the data was collected in the from of individual JSON files, and the startup quickly realized that its data analysts and scientists are having a hard time leveraging the data that way. Hence, the executives decided to bring a data engineer onto the team to make the data available in a PostgreSQL database instead.

I completed this project as part of the [Udacity Data Engineering nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027).
